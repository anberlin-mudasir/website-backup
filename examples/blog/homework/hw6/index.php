<li><b>Homework 0:</b> Two questions:<br/>
  <ol>
  <li>What are JavaScript browser sniffers?</li>
  <li>Why are they so commonly used in javascripts?</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="ans">
    <ol>
    <li>A JavaScript browser sniffer is a browser identifier, it 
        will tell which browser, version and operating system the visitors 
        are using. 
        <a href="http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/74554248#reply-box-252913079">Well...</a>
    </li>
    <li>Because Javascript is not totally compatible among different environments, 
        to make it worse, different version of Javascript varies quite a lot, thus 
        necessary to check the type to browser, OS, and the version of Javascript
        supported in advance.

<li><b>Homework 5:</b>wizardForm.html<br/>
  <ol>
  <li>Use a regular expression to check age is numbers only (HINT: look for non-numbers) and is sensible value (5 < age < 150 ) </li>
  <li>Write a CGI/PHP program to process the form  and submit if all is OK.You could use dump.pl (as given in the course FAQ) to printout the form values. Note that checkSubmit() is blocking the form from submitting - what should you change to allow this? You would receive a bonus if you realized more functions with javascript. Remember to mention your efforts on your pages.</li>
