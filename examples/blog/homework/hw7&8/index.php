<li><b>Homework 1:</b>
  <p>Research by loading these files on as many different browser types and versions as you can find (e.g. IE, Opera, Safari and Mozilla family). Snapshot what happens and include these images on your web site. </p>
  <div class="ans">
    The "&lt;object&gt;" tag refering an applet is not supported in 
    firefox. Therefore, I use "&lt;applet&gt;" tag instead.<br />
    Results show here:

  </div>
</li>
<li><b>Homework 2:</b>
  <p>Experiment with applet graphics (AWT and Swing). Create a simple applet to draw a red square and a green circle (hint: Use drawRect/fillRect and drawOval/fillOval methods - Sebesta has examples).</p>
  <div class="ans">
    Please check <span><a href="hw7&8/hw2.php">this</a></span>.

<li><b>Homework 3:</b>
  <p>Add to your applet to draw a third shape, determined by parameters passed from the HTML file that determine the shape and colour to draw. </p>
  <div class="ans">
    <span><a href="hw7&8/hw3.php">Here</a></span> shows the result.

<li><b>Homework 4:</b>
  <p>Write a brief (less than 200 words) essay outlining the differences between AWT and Swing graphics.  You may find it useful to visit the Sun Java website.</p>
  <div class="ans">
    In general, Swing has many advanced features than AWT.
    <ul>
    <li>Comparing with Swing components, AWT components are heavy weight, i.e OS dependent</li>
    <li>AWT component is one that is always associated with its own native screen resource where Swing component is one that "borrows" or get the screen resource of it's parents.</li>
    <li>Swing components support "Model View Control" architetcure while AWT components support Delegate Event Model</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<li><b>Homework 5:</b>
  <p>For additional credit: use threads to implement some sort of animation ... try moving the shapes around. Maybe you could implement a pingpong game.  </p>
  <div class="ans">
    <span><a href="hw7&8/hw5.php">Here</a></span>is the thread example.
