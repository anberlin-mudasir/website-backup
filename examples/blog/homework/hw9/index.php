<ul>
<li><b>Homework 1:</b>
  <p>Write a post on your blog, comment on this post, send a trackback to a public Web Site which provides Trackback URL and Receive a Trackback from somewhere(Maybe another post of your blog). </p>
  <div class="ans">
    Here provides the link: 
    <span><a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/b2e2009/blogs/u/jianghan/index.php/2011/11/26/week-9-trackback-test1">Test 1</a></span> will receive a trackback from
    <span><a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/b2e2009/blogs/u/jianghan/index.php/2011/11/26/week-9-trackback-test2">Test 2</a></span>.<br />
    And I also send a trackback to another blog with 
    <span><a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/b2e2009/blogs/u/jianghan/index.php/2011/11/26/week-9-trackback-test3">Test3</a></span>, 
    but I have to wait for moderation: <span><a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/b2e2009/blogs/u/lccycc/index.php/2011/11/25/traceback-test2">Target page</a></span>
  </div>
</li>
</ul>
