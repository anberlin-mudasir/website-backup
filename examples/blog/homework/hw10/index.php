<ul>
<li><b>Homework 1:</b>
  <p>Develop an XML file to represent a book of recipes. The data in this example (<a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/webtech/unit7UWE/cook.xml">cook.xml</a>) is very poorly designed but you may wish to use it as starting point. </p>
  <div class="ans">
    Please check this: <span><a href="hw10/cook.xml">mycook.xml</a></span>
  </div>
</li>

<li><b>Homework 2:</b>
  <p>Create and validate (with xsv) an XML schema with appropriate data for a recipe book. (Once you have successfully validated your files with xsv, cut-and-paste the xsv response to your homework page.)</p>
  <div class="ans">
    Here is the xsd file: <span><a href="hw10/cookbook.xsd">mycookbook.xsd</a></span>
    <br />
    And validate result shows below:<br />
    <b>Schema validating with XSV 3.1-1 of 2007/12/11 16:20:05</b><br/>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Target</b>: file:/usr/local/XSV/xsvlog/tmpapzlEsuploaded<br/>
          (Real name: cookbook.xsd)</li>
      <li><b>docElt</b>: {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}schema</li>
      <li>Validation was strict, starting with type [Anonymous]</li>
      <li>The schema(s) used for schema-validation had no errors</li>
      <li>No schema-validity problems were found in the target</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>


<li><b>Homework 3:</b>
  <p>Format your XML using an XSLT stylesheet (for example <a href="http://162.105.203.19/wst/webtech/unit7UWE/cookbook.xsl">cookbook.xsl</a>). </p>
  <div class="ans">
    The xml in <b>Homework 1</b> has already been formatted. 
    Here is the xsl file: <span><a href="hw10/cookbook.xsl">mycookbook.xsl</a></span>
  </div>
</li>


<li><b>Homework 4:</b>
  <p>Include links to your .xsl, .xsd and .xml files on your homework page. </p>
  <div class="ans">
    <ul>
      <li><span><a href="hw10/cook.xml">mycook.xml</a></span></li>
      <li><span><a href="hw10/cookbook.xsl">mycookbook.xsl</a></span></li>
      <li><span><a href="hw10/cookbook.xsd">mycookbook.xsd</a></span></li>
    <ul>
  </div>

<li><b>Homework 5:</b>
